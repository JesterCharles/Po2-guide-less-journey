# Path of Exile 2 Guide-less Journey

With the launch of Path of Exile 2 I've decided to just go about this journey on my own. Now I'll freely share this over the internet to some friends, but the main idea is to learn as much as I can about the game without any insight to what content creators are pushing out there. I'd like learn as much as I can about all the interactions within this game to truly get a grasp on what I'm seeing and doing. Taking information down as I see it and testing everything I can to make sure I understand the interactions correctly. Yes this is probably a ridiculous journey for it, but something about Path of Exile 2 has driven me to this insane idea of playing the game as if there were no guides on the internet. Kinda kickin' it old school when games didn't have the internet to figure out every single details, min-max the meta builds within a few days of new material launching. Will this be bad, probably, will it be fun, probably not, but screw it here we are. 

**Just a side note**: I'm NOT going to completely ignore friends/gaming buddies with any of the details they have to share, this is simply a spot for me to keep all of my information tightly packaged for my continued experience over the course of Path of Exile 2. Everything I do will be learned either by playing the game or interactions with my friends while I'm playing. I do still plan to utilizing tools like the poe2db, build planners and patch notes here and there, but these are just tools to help me learn or view things while I'm not in game.

## Goals

1. Learn the Acts -- this is entirely so I can make them as fast as possible for league starts, because I HATE slogging through the campaign
2. Learn the Early-Game Meta -- what's strongest so I can get through it the fastest (I hope I can tackle 1 & 2 simultaneously)
3. Make Fun builds -- gonna be spending a lot of time here testing in-game mechanics
3. Endgame -- learn the systems I hope to be playing for a long time...

### Changelog

12/11/2023 -- Made it through Huntings Grounds in Act one obtaining all the information I could. Will continue to compile routes to discern patterns with further run throughs.
